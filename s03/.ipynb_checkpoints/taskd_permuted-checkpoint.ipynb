    "We can observe that for the MLP and CNN networks, accuracies obtained with the normal dataset and the permuted dataset are quite similar. It is not surprising as classes (0 to 9) are separated by similar patterns (in each class), which could be the representation that humans naturaly see (8 for example). But the permutation used for this exercise enables the network to still recognize a pattern for each class. Thus, it means that it transforms each class in a \"unique\" and separable way. We could have obtained a worse score with a different kind of permutation."
